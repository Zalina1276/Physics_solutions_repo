# Problem 1

<span style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection</span>

#### Motivation:

Projectile motion, while seemingly simple, offers a rich playground for exploring fundamental principles of physics. The problem is straightforward: analyze how the range of a projectile depends on its angle of projection. Yet, beneath this simplicity lies a complex and versatile framework. The equations governing projectile motion involve both linear and quadratic relationships, making them accessible yet deeply insightful.

What makes this topic particularly compelling is the number of free parameters involved in these equations, such as initial velocity, gravitational acceleration, and launch height. These parameters give rise to a diverse set of solutions that can describe a wide array of real-world phenomena, from the arc of a soccer ball to the trajectory of a rocket.

#### Task:

- Derive the equations of motion for projectile moiton
- Analyze the range as a function of the launch angle
- Determine the optimal angle for maximum range

#### Deliverables:

- Derivations and analytical results
- Graphs illustarting the range vs launch angle
- Discussion on the optimal launch angle and its implications

#### Hints and resources:

- Utilize kinematic equations and trigonometric identities
- Consider air resistance and other real-world factors in advanced analyses

This task encourages a deep understanding of projectile motion while showcasing its versatility and applicability across various domains.
