</span>

#### Motivation:

The forced damped pendulum is a captivating example of a physical system with intricate behavior resulting from the interplay of damping, restoring forces, and external driving forces. By introducing both damping and external periodic forcing, the system demonstrates a transition from simple harmonic motion to a rich spectrum of dynamics, including resonance, chaos, and quasiperiodic behavior. These phenomena serve as a foundation for understanding complex real-world systems, such as driven oscillators, climate systems, and mechanical structures under periodic stress.

Adding forcing introduces new parameters, such as the amplitude and frequency of the external force, which significantly affect the pendulum's behavior. By systematically varying these parameters, a diverse class of solutions can be observed, including synchronized oscillations, chaotic motion, and resonance phenomena. These behaviors not only highlight fundamental physics principles but also provide insights into engineering applications such as energy harvesting, vibration isolation, and mechanical resonance.

## Solution

### 1. Theoretical Foundation

#### Governing Equation
The motion of a forced damped pendulum is described by the second-order nonlinear differential equation:

$$
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + b \frac{d\theta}{dt} + \frac{g}{L} \sin\theta = A \cos(\omega t)
$$

where:
- $\theta$ - the angular displacement,
- $b$ - the damping coefficient,
- $g$ - the gravitational acceleration,
- $L$ - the length of the pendulum,
- $A$ - the amplitude of the external forcing,
- $\omega$ - the driving frequency.

#### Small-Angle Approximation
For small angles ($\theta \approx \sin\theta$), the equation simplifies to:

$$
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + b \frac{d\theta}{dt} + \frac{g}{L} \theta = A \cos(\omega t)
$$

This is a linear, non-homogeneous differential equation that can be solved using standard methods. The solution consists of a transient part (damped oscillations) and a steady-state part (driven oscillations).

### Resonance Conditions
Resonance occurs when the driving frequency $\omega$ is close to the system's natural frequency:

$$
\omega_0 = \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}}
$$

At resonance, energy transfer is maximized, leading to large amplitude oscillations.

### 2. Analysis of Dynamics
We investigate how damping ($b$), driving amplitude ($A$), and frequency ($\omega$) influence the motion:
- **Low damping**: The system exhibits sustained oscillations.
- **High damping**: Motion quickly dies out.
- **Resonance**: Maximum amplitude is observed at a specific $\omega$.
- **Chaotic motion**: At certain parameter ranges, the system transitions into chaotic behavior.


### 3. Practical Applications
- **Energy Harvesting**: Used in piezoelectric generators.
- **Suspension Bridges**: Understanding oscillations helps prevent failures (e.g., Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse).
- **RLC Circuits**: Analogous behavior in driven electrical oscillators.

### 4. Implementation: Python Simulation

Below is a Python script that numerically solves the differential equation using the Runge-Kutta method and visualizes the motion.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp

# Parameters
g = 9.81  # Gravity (m/s^2)
L = 1.0   # Length of pendulum (m)
b = 0.2   # Damping coefficient
A = 1.2   # Driving amplitude
omega = 2.0  # Driving frequency

def pendulum_eq(t, y):
    theta, omega_t = y
    dydt = [omega_t, -b*omega_t - (g/L)*np.sin(theta) + A*np.cos(omega*t)]
    return dydt

# Initial conditions
t_span = (0, 50)
y0 = [0.2, 0]
t_eval = np.linspace(*t_span, 1000)

# Solve ODE
sol = solve_ivp(pendulum_eq, t_span, y0, t_eval=t_eval, method='RK45')

# Plot results
plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
plt.plot(sol.t, sol.y[0], label='Angular Displacement (theta)')
plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
plt.ylabel('Theta (radians)')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Forced Damped Pendulum Motion')
plt.grid()
plt.show()
